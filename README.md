699 patients who may have a benign tumor (Class = 2) or a malignant tumor (Class = 4). In addition to a Sample Code Number, there are 9 biological features rated with integer values from 1 to 10: Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli and Mitoses. We will reduce them into 2 variables with Principal Component Analysis. Then, we will classify the patients with a Support Vector Machine. The objective is to predict the tumor class (benign or malignant) of a patient.
